# Music Organizing and Querying Utility

Create a file with the format:

--- Artist1 ---
Song1
Song2
...

--- Artist2 ---
Song1
Song2
...

...


Use the recommend music script to then search through and filter songs.
I find it really nice to the names and artists of songs I like locally, and use this utility to recommend myself music.
Over time it's quite nice to go back and listen to the same stuff that I listened to a long time ago.
I'm sure this script can be adapted to do other things, so feel free to do so.


Usage:
Set the file to be parsed at the top of the script

python3 recommend_music.py :: Selects random song from the file

python3 recommend_music.py -a artist :: Selects random song by artist. artist is case and space insensitive, and will work with partial string matches as well. Ex. python3 recommend_music.py -a edsheer 

python3 recommend_music.py --all :: Add the --all flag to give all songs that match your filter criteria. Can be used with artist or tags

python3 recommend_music.py -t :: Give random song with matching tag. A tag is inserted into the file using [tag]. It is then searched for by the tag itself(not using the brackets). Ex. python3 recommend_music.py -t happy

python3 recommend_music.py --tags tag1 tag2 :: Use the tags flag to require multipl tags to be present for a song to be selected.

All the flags are composable, and can be used together.
Use python recommend_music.py --help to see all the cli options
